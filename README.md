# BrickoutClone
A clone of the classic Brickout game in using C, GTK for a window context, OpenGL for rendering, dashGL for managing matrix manipulations. Planning on finishing this game before returning to the Asteroids Clone.

## TO DO:
   * Finish Gameover screen
       * Display Gameover text on screen
       * Display score on screen
       * Press space to go back to start screen
       * Implement Game states for game, gamover, and start
    * Start Screen
       * Press space to enter into game state
       * Display last 5 scores and the highest score from the playsession
