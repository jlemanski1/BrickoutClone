# BrickoutClone
A clone of the classic Brickout game in using C, GTK for a window context, OpenGL for rendering, dashGL for managing matrix manipulations. Planning on finishing this game before returning to the Asteroids Clone.

## TODO:
   * Gameover screen
       * When ball collides with bottom of window
   * Player score
       * Award score on brick breaks
       * Show final score on Gameover screen
